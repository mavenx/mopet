\chapter{Introduction}

You know the problem: You are on a sightseeing-trep in a city and want to take a picture of some
building or just a nice place. But there are annoying persons moving around in front
of the object!

So why don't you use our MOPET Software?
All you need is a series of about 10 pictures of the object. The software 
detects all moving persons and objects and removes them.
